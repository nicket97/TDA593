# TDA593

## Open with IntelliJ
It's easier to not clone via IntelliJ's version control. Clone the project with the command line. In IntelliJ, choose `File > Open`, and pick the folder **TDA593/ROVU/Core/** to open. This is the easiest solution, since IntelliJ messes it up if you open up the enclosing folder, it won't be able to locate the `src`-folder. 

Set your Project SDK to version **1.8** in `File > Project Structure...`.
